# Predicting PM2.5 Values from Satellite and Weather Data Using Graph Recurrent Neural Network

Accurate prediction of Particulate Matter (PM2.5) values can better inform public to take protective actions on daily basis. However, no accurate predictor for ground-level PM2.5 values exists. Additionally, the information needed to predict PM2.5 is not well understood. This work is part of a NASAâ€™s challenge to develop highly accurate PM2.5 predictor. In order to build models, a comprehensive explorationof available data from different sources was conducted which led to the selection of both satellite and weather information. Three baseline models namely Naive One Step Lookbehind, FNN, and RNN were developed. The proposed models are Edge-GNN which used a GRU and an edge-weighted graph model, and a GCN with GRU to generate PM2.5 values. The results showed similar, but slightly betterperformance for the GCN model (percent error: 22.84%) over the Edge-GNN(percent error: 24.7%). Overall, we find better performance from our proposed models when compared to the baselines.
